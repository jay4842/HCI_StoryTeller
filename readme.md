# The dataset
Using ImageNet to pull images and labels. 
Due to how large the dataset is we will start with only ten classes.  
For each class we will also provide text data or stories.  
  
The classes will be:  
- Dog, cat, bird, person, toy, cup, bunny, cow, fish, and sloth.  

The image dataset will be the urls for each image synset.   
Images retrieved from the ImageNet website[http://image-net.org/index].
