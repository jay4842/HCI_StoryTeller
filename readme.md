# The dataset
Using ImageNet to pull images and labels.  
Due to how large the dataset is we will start with only ten classes.  
For each class we will also provide text data or stories.  
  
The classes will be:  
- Dog, cat, bird, person, toy, cup, bunny, cow, fish, and sloth.  

The image dataset will be the urls for each image synset.   
Images retrieved from the ImageNet [website](http://image-net.org/index).  
  
## Downloading  
Using the `download.py` file you can download all ten classes images. The  
`runner.py` file will handle splitting data into test and train splits.  
This will be done by doing a 70/30 split. Keep in mind that it will take  
some time to finish downloading all the images.
